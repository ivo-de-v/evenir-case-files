# Context

This is the code for the Evenir Case Files, a research game I developed a few years ago for my undergraduate dissertation at the University of Glasgow.

An accompanying paper has since been published in the peer-reviewed International Journal Of Game Based Learning ([you can read the it here](https://www.igi-global.com/gateway/article/323138)), so I thought to share the game as well.

I learned a number of things in the ~6 months it took me to complete this project, including React.js itself.

From a research perspective, this game was unique in the academic landscape in that it tackled the problem of transfer learning and domain-specific knowledge - the fundamental question was, can playing a game teach me to think like a professional historian? This was a very different question from the skill-specific ones most other game-based learning scholars were asking.

From a game perspective, I still feel that an investigative game based on reading text and finding answers by picking out relevant pieces of information is a relatively unexplored core game mechanic. If anyone would be interested in extending this, I'd be happy to hear about it. You can contact me [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivo-de-vero/)
